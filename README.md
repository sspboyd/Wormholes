Simplified sketch to illustrate a problem I'm having saving and retrieving frames from a webcam.

I'm trying to save frames from my MacBook's web camera to an ArrayList<PImage> and then show three images from the ArrayList. The problem I'm having is that even though I'm pulling PImages from three different locations in the array I keep getting three of the exact same most recent images. Am I not referencing different locations in the ArrayList correctly?
Am I not referencing different locations in the ArrayList correctly?

This sketch goes with a post I'm writing on the Processing Forum.
